There are two types of tests listed: test sequences, which are used to run full production tests, and manual tests, which are used to test a single subcircuit. It is recommended to test all boards using a test sequence first, and to use the manual tests for diagnosing issues with individual boards, or for re-testing repaired boards.

## Test Sequences

These sequences are used as production tests for the TK-1 and TP-1.

### TK-1 production test (tk1_test_sequence)

This test checks all major subcircuits on the TK-1, and is used to verify that the PCBA was assembled correctly. It should be run on all newly assembled TK-1 boards.

Requirements:

* Programmed MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer board, fitted with a wider (green) plastic clip
* Unprogrammed TK-1
* USB micro cable to attach TP-1 board to computer
* USB C extension cable to attach TK-1 to computer

It runs the following tests, in order:

    voltage_test
    flash_validate_id
    flash_program
    sleep_2
    test_extra_io
    ch552_program
    test_txrx_touchpad

Note: If the CH552 has been programmed already, then the test sequence will fail. In that case, manually run the other tests in the sequence, skipping the 'ch554_program' test.

### TP-1 (tp1_test_sequence)

This test programs a TP-1, then tests that it can program a TK-1. It should be run on all newly assembled TP-1 boards.


Requirements:

* Unprogrammed TP-1
* TK-1 programmed with the application test gateware
* USB micro cable to attach TP-1 board to computer

The TP-1 production test runs the following tests, in order:

    program_pico
    sleep_2
    flash_validate_id

### MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer (mta1_usb_v1_programmer_test_sequence)

Requirements:

* Unprogrammed MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer
* TK-1 programmed with the application test gateware
* USB micro cable to attach MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer board to computer

The TP-1 production test runs the following tests, in order:

    program_pico,
    sleep_2,
    voltage_test,
    flash_validate_id,
    sleep_2,
    test_extra_io

## Individual tests

These tests target a specific sub-circuit or funcationality on the TP-1 and TK-1. Each test is designed to be run in isolation, however thy might have 

### program_pico: Load the ice40 flasher firmware onto the TP-1

This test loads the ice40_flasher firmware into the TP-1.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach an unprogrammed TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Run the test.
3. The test program will copy the firmware onto the TP-1.
4. Once the firmware is copied, the TP-1 will automatically reset, and re-initialize as a ice40_flasher.

Notes:
* This test assumes that the computer is configured to auto-mount USB storage devices, and that the Pico will be mounted to /media/lab/RPI-RP2. This is true for a computer runnnig Ubuntu 22.10 when a user is logged into a Gnome GUI session. The script will need to be adjusted for other environments.

### voltage_test: Measure 3.3V 2.5V, and 1.2V voltage rails on the TK-1

This test uses ADC in the Pico to measure the power supplies on the TP-1. It samples the voltage of each power supply multiple times, averages the result, and verifies that they are within +/-0.2V of the specification.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer. The TK-1 can be programmed or unprogrammed.
3. Run the test.
4. The test will use the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to power on the TK-1, measure the voltage rails, then power off the TK-1.
5. The test will report the measurements and pass/fail metric.

Notes:
* The accuracy of the ADC is poor; external hardware would be required to do a more extensive test. The power supplies used are all fixed-voltage devices, so the chance of of an off-spec (but still working) device is considered to be low.
* This test does not verify that the power sequencing is correct.

### flash_validate_id: Read the ID from TK-1 SPI flash, and verify that it's not all 0's or 1's

This test uses the TP-1 or MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to read a TK-1 SPI flash ID. It can be used to quickly check if a TK-1 device is inserted properly into the programmger.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer or TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer. The TK-1 can be programmed or unprogrammed.
3. Run the test.
4. The test will use the programmer to power on the TP-1, read out the SPI flash ID, then power off the TK-1.
5. The test will check if the flash ID matches any known valid flash ID types.
6. If the flash ID matches an known value, the test will print the type and return a pass metric.
7. If the flash ID does not match a known value, the test will print the type and return a pass metric.

Notes:
* An earlier version of this test just checked if the flash ID was 0x00000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF; this version is more exact.

### flash_program: Program and verify the TK-1 SPI flash with the application test gateware

This test uses the TP-1 or MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to write the application test gateware a TK-1 SPI flash. This gateware is needed to run the test_extra_io and test_txrx_touchpad tests. The test uses the external iceprog utility to perform the flash operation.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer or TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer. The TK-1 can be programmed or unprogrammed.
3. Run the test.
4. The test will use the programmer to power on the TP-1, program the SPI flash with the gateware, verify the flash by reading the data back out, then power off the TK-1.
5. The test will report a pass/fail metric vased on the result of the verification phase

### flash_check: Verify the TK-1 SPI flash is programmed with the application test gateware

This test uses the TP-1 or MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to verify that the application test gateware is written to a TK-1 SPI flash. The test uses the external iceprog utility to perform the verification operation.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer or TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a programmed TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer.
3. Run the test.
4. The test will use the programmer to power on the TP-1, verify the flash by reading the data back out, then power off the TK-1.
5. The test will report a pass/fail metric vased on the result of the verification phase

### test_extra_io: Test the TK-1 RTS, CTS, and GPIO1-4 lines by measuring a test pattern generated by the app_test gateware

This test uses MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to verify that the RTS, CTS, and GPIO1-4 lines are connected correctly to the ICE40 FPGA.

On the FPGA side, the application gateware implements a simple state machine for this test. The RTS line is configured as an input, and the CTS, GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO3, and GPIO4 lines are configured as outputs. The values of the outputs are configured so that only one output is high at a time, while the rest are low. After reset, the GPIO4 line is high. Each time the RTS line is toggled, the next output on the list is set high.

On the programmer side, the Pico GPIO pin connected to the TK-1 RTS line is configured as an output, and the Pico GPIO pins connected to the other TK-1 line are configured as inputs. The pico checks that each input line is working by cycling the RTS output high and low, then reading the values of each input. This process is repeated 5 times until all output lines are measured, then the results are compared to a table of expected values.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer or TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a programmed TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer.
3. Run the test.
4. The test will use the programmer to power on the TP-1, run the IO test, then power off the TK-1.
5. The test will report a pass/fail metric vased on the result of the test

### ch552_program: Load the CDC ACM firmware onto a CH552 with a randomly generated serial number, and verify that it boots correctly
### test_txrx_touchpad: Test UART communication, RGB LED, and touchpad by asking the operator to interact with the touch pad
### enable_power: Enable power to the TK-1

This test uses the TP-1 or MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to enable power to an attached TK-1. This isn't a functional test, but can be used for manual testing such as measuring voltage rails with a multimeter, probing clock signals with an oscilloscope, etc.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer or TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer. The TK-1 can be programmed or unprogrammed.
3. Run the test.
4. The test will use the programmer to power on the TP-1
5. The test will report a pass metric if the command completed successfully.

### disable_power: Disable power to the TK-1

This test uses the TP-1 or MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer to disable power to an attached TK-1. This isn't a functional test, but can be used after the enable_power command was used to turn on a device.

Usage instructions:
1. Attach a programmed/tested MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer or TP-1 to the computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Place a TK-1 into the MTA1_USB_V1_Programmer. The TK-1 can be programmed or unprogrammed.

## Firmware binaries

To make the test environment easier to set up, some pre-compiled binares are included in the binaries/ subdirectory. These can also be built from source, by following the below instructions.

Before building the firmware, follow the [toolchain setup](https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis-key1/blob/main/doc/toolchain_setup.md) instructions.

### CH552 firmware

This is built using SDCC:

    cd ~/tillitis-key1/hw/boards/mta1-usb-v1/ch552_fw
    make
    cp usb_device_cdc.bin ../test/binaries/

### Test Application gateware

This uses the Symbiflow toolchain:

    cd ~/tillitis-key1/hw/boards/mta1-usb-v1/test/app_test
    make
    cp top.bin ../binaries/

### TP-1 Raspberry Pi Pico firmware

Follow the instructions in the [ice40_flasher](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/ice40_flasher#building-the-firmware) repository, then copy the output 'main.uf2' file to the binaries directory.
