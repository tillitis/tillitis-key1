# Device libraries for the Tillitis TKey

- C runtime: libcrt0.
- Common C functions including protocol calls: libcommon.
- Cryptographic functions: libmonocypher. Based on
  [Monocypher](https://github.com/LoupVaillant/Monocypher) version
  4.0.2
- BLAKE2s hash function: libblake2s.

### SPDX tags

The project uses single-line references to Unique License Identifiers
as defined by the Linux Foundation's [SPDX project](https://spdx.org/)
on its own source files, but not necessarily imported files. The line
in each individual source file identifies the license applicable to
that file.

## Hardware support

### Bellatrix and earlier

Please note that:

- For reading, only use the blocking `uart_read()`.

- Only `IO_UART` and `IO_QEMU` destinations are useful for writing as
  in `write(IO_UART, ...)`, `puts(IO_UART, ...)`, and so on.

- Defining `QEMU_DEBUG` works with all the `debug_*` functions, but
  `TKEY_DEBUG` does not.

## Building

In order to build, you must have the `make`, `clang`, `llvm`, and
`lld` packages installed.

Version 15 or higher of LLVM/Clang is necessary for the RV32IC\_Zmmul
architecture we are using. For more detailed information on the
supported build and development environment, please refer to the
[Developer Handbook](https://dev.tillitis.se/).
## Building using Podman

You can also build the libraries with our OCI image
`ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder`.

The easiest way to build this is if you have `make` installed:

```
make podman
```

You can also specify a different image by using
`IMAGE=localhost/tkey-builder-local`.

Or use Podman directly:

```
podman run --rm --mount type=bind,source=.,target=/src -w /src -it ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder:4 make -j
```

## Minimal application build

You will typically need to link at least the `libcrt0` C runtime
otherwise your program won't even reach `main()`.

We provide a linker script in `apps.lds` which shows the linker the
memory layout.

Minimal compilation would look something like:

```
clang -target riscv32-unknown-none-elf -march=rv32iczmmul -mabi=ilp32 \
  -mcmodel=medany -static -std=gnu99 -O2 -ffast-math -fno-common \
  -fno-builtin-printf -fno-builtin-putchar -nostdlib -mno-relax -flto \
  -Wall -Werror=implicit-function-declaration \
  -I ../tkey-libs/include \
  -I ../tkey-libs -c -o foo.o foo.c

clang -target riscv32-unknown-none-elf -march=rv32iczmmul -mabi=ilp32 \
  -mcmodel=medany -static -ffast-math -fno-common -nostdlib \
  -T ../tkey-libs/app.lds \
  -L ../tkey-libs -lcrt0 \
  -I ../tkey-libs -o foo.elf foo.o

```

## Makefile example

See `example-app/Makefile` for an example Makefile for a simple device
application.

## Debug output

If you want to have debug prints in your program you can use the
`debug_putchar()`, `debug_puts()`, `debug_putinthex()`,
`debug_hexdump()` and friends. See `include/tkey/debug.h` for list of
functions.

These functions will be turned on if you define either of these when
compiling your program and linking with `libcommon`:

- `QEMU_DEBUG`: Uses the special debug port only available in qemu to
  print to the qemu console.
- `TKEY_DEBUG`: Uses the extra HID device.

Note that if you use `TKEY_DEBUG` you *must* have something listening
on the corresponding HID device. It's usually the last HID device
created. On Linux, for instance, this means the last reported hidraw
in `dmesg` is the one you should do `cat /dev/hidrawX` on.
