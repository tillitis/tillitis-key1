# tk1

## Introduction

The tk1 core is where information, control and monitoring
functionality unique to the TKey1 can be found. This means that it
provides more than one distinct functionality accessible via the core
API.


## API

### Access to device information

```
ADDR_NAME0:   0x00
ADDR_NAME1:   0x01
ADDR_VERSION: 0x02
```

These addresses provide read only information about the name (type)
and version of the device. They can be read by FW as well as
applications.


### Control of execution mode

```
ADDR_SYSTEM_MODE_CTRL: 0x08
```

This register controls if the device is executing in FW mode or in App
mode. The register can be written once between power cycles, and only
by FW. If set the device is in app mode.


### Control of RGB LED

```
ADDR_LED:  0x09
LED_B_BIT: 0
LED_G_BIT: 1
LED_R_BIT: 2
```

This register control the RGB LED on the TKey device. Setting a bit to
one turns the corresponding color on. It can be read and written by FW
as well as by Apps.


### Control and status of GPIO

```
ADDR_GPIO: 0x0a
GPIO1_BIT: 0
GPIO2_BIT: 1
GPIO3_BIT: 2
GPIO4_BIT: 3
```

This register control and provide status access to the four GPIOs on
the TKey. GPIO one and two are inputs. They will sample the input
level and present it to SW. GPIO three and four are outputs. They will
emit either high or low voltage level depending on if the
corresponding register is one or zero.


### Application introspection

```
ADDR_APP_START: 0x0c
ADDR_APP_SIZE:  0x0d
```

These registers provide read only information to the loaded app to
itself - where it was loaded and its size. The values are written by
FW as part of the loading of the app. The registers can't be written
when the `ADDR_SYSTEM_MODE_CTRL` has been set.


### Access to Blake2s

```
ADDR_BLAKE2S: 0x10
```

This register provides the 32-bit function pointer address to the
Blake2s hash function in the FW. It is written by FW during boot. The
register can't be written to when the `ADDR_SYSTEM_MODE_CTRL` has been
set.


### Access to CDI

```
ADDR_CDI_FIRST: 0x20
ADDR_CDI_LAST:  0x27
```

These registers provide access to the 256-bit compound device secret
calculated by the FW as part of loading an application. The registers
are written by the FW. The register can't be written to when the
`ADDR_SYSTEM_MODE_CTRL` has been set. The CDI is readable by apps,
which can then use it as a base secret for any other secrets required
to carry out their intended use case.


### Access to UDI

```
ADDR_UDI_FIRST: 0x30
ADDR_UDI_LAST:  0x31
```

These read-only registers provide access to the 64-bit Unique Device
Identity (UDI).

The two UDI words are stored using 32 named SB\_LUT4 FPGA multiplexer
(MUX) instances, identified in the source code as "udi\_rom\_idx". One
instance for each bit in core read_data output bus.

Each SB\_LUT4 MUX is able to store 16 bits of data, in total 512 bits.
But since the UDI is 64 bits, we only use the two LSBs in each MUX.
Note that only the LSB address of the SB\_LUT4 instances are connected
to the CPU address. This means that only the two LSBs in each MUX can
be addressed.

During build of the FPGA design, the UDI is set to a known bit
pattern, which means that the SB\_LUT4 instantiations are initialized
to a fixed bit pattern.

The tool 'patch\_uds\_udi.py' is used to replace the fixed bit pattern
with a unique bit pattern before generating the per device unique FPGA
bitstream. This allows us to generate these device unique FPGA
bitstreams without having to do a full FPGA build.


### RAM memory protection

```
ADDR_RAM_ADDR_RAND: 0x40
ADDR_RAM_DATA_RAND: 0x41
```

These write only registers control how the data in the RAM is
randomized as a way of protecting the data. The randomization is
implemented using a pseudo random number generator with a state
initialized by a seed.

The `ADDR_RAM_ADDR_RAND` store the seed for how the addresses are
randomized over the memory space. The `ADDR_RAM_DATA_RAND` store the
seed for how the data itself is randomized. FW writes random seed
values to these registers during boot.


### Security monitor

```
ADDR_CPU_MON_CTRL: 0x60
ADDR_CPU_MON_FIRST:0x61
ADDR_CPU_MON_LAST: 0x62
```

Monitors events and state changes in the SoC and handles security
violations. Currently checks for:

1. Trying to access memory that is outside of the defined size of the
   defined memory areas. *Always enabled*
2. Trying to execute instructions in FW\_RAM. *Always enabled.*
3. Trying to execute instructions from a memory area in RAM defined by
   the application.

Number 1 and 2 are always enabled. Number 3 is set and enabled by the
device application. Once enabled, by writing to `ADDR_CPU_MON_CTRL`,
the memory defined by `ADDR_CPU_MON_FIRST` and `ADDR_CPU_MON_LAST`
will be protected against execution. Typically the application
developer will set this protection to cover the application stack
and/or heap.

An application can write to these registers to define the area and
then enable the monitor. Once enabled the monitor can't be disabled,
and the `ADDR_CPU_MON_FIRST` and `ADDR_CPU_MON_LAST` registers can't be
changed. This means that an application that wants to use the monitor
must define the area first before enabling the monitor.

Once enabled, if the CPU tries to read an instruction from the defined
area, the core will force the CPU to instead read an all zero, which
is an illegal instruction. This illegal instruction will trigger the
CPU to enter its TRAP state, from which it can't return unless the
TKey is power cycled.

The firmware will not write to these registers as part of loading an
app. The app developer must define the area and enable the monitor to
get the protection.

One feature not obvious from the API is that when the CPU traps the
core will detect that and start flashing the status LED with a red
light indicating that the CPU is in a trapped state and no further
execution is possible.

## SPI-master

The TK1 includes a minimal SPI-master that provides access to the
Winbond Flash memory mounted on the board. The SPI-master is byte
oriented and very minimalistic.

In order to transfer more than a single byte, SW must read status and
write commands needed to send a sequence of bytes. In order to read
out a sequence of bytes from the memory, SW must send as many dummy
bytes as the data being read from the memory.

The SPI-master is controlled using a few API
addresses:

```
ADDR_SPI_EN:   0x80
ADDR_SPI_XFER: 0x81
ADDR_SPI_DATA: 0x82
```

`ADDR_SPI_EN` enables and disabled the SPI-master. Writing a 0x01 will
lower the SPI chip select to the memory. Writing a 0x00 will raise the
chip select.

Writing to the `ADDR_SPI_XFER` starts a byte transfer. Reading from
the address returns the status for the SPI-master. If the return value
is not zero, the SPI-master is ready to send a byte.

`ADDR_SPI_DATA` is the address used to send and receive a byte. data.
The least significant byte will be sent to the memory during a
transfer. The byte returned from the memory will be presented to SW if
the address is read after a transfer has completed.

The sequence of operations needed to perform is thus:

1. Activate the SPI-master by writing a 0x00000001 to ADDR_SPI_EN
2. Write a byte to `ADDR_SPI_DATA`
3. Read `ADDR_SPI_XFER` to check status. Repeat until the read
   operation returns non-zero value
4. Write to `ADDR_SPI_XFER`
5. Read `ADDR_SPI_XFER` to check status. Repeat until the read operation
   returns a non-zero value
6. Read out the received byte from `ADDR_SPI_DATA`
7. Repeat 2..6 as many times as needed to send a command and data to
   the memory and getting the expected status, data back.
8. Deactivate the SPI-master by writing 0x00000000 to `ADDR_SPI_EN`

The SPI connected memory on the board is the Winbond W25Q80. For

## System Reset

The TK1 includes an ability for FW and applications to trigger a
hardware reset of the FPGA by writing to an API address.

The hardware reset will force all registers that are in the Tkey FPGA
design reset circuit to be reset to their default values. Basically
this is all registers in the Tkey FPGA design.

The reset will not clear the RAM. However since the CPU program
counter is reset to its reset vector, the CPU will unconditionally
start executing the FW. As part of the device initialization, the FW
will fill the RAM with random data, overwriting any app and
data present in the RAM before the reset was triggered.

The hardware reset will not force the FPGA to read its
configuration. That requires a power cycle of the Tkey device.

The reset is controlled by the following API address. Note that
any value written to the address will trigger the reset.

```
ADDR_SYSTEM_RESET: 0x70
```


## Implementation

The core is implemented as a single module. Future versions will
probably be separated into separate modules.


## Winbond Flash memory model

The testbench for the SPI master requires a memory model of the
Winbond Flash memory. The model [can be downloaded from
Winbond](https://www.winbond.com/hq/support/documentation/downloadV2022.jsp?__locale=en&xmlPath=/support/resources/.content/item/DA02-KAG049.html&level=2)
by providing the requested information and supplying the received
verification code.

From the downloaded file 'W25Q80DL.zip', please extract the file
W25Q80DL.v and place it in the 'tb' directory before building the
simulation model.
